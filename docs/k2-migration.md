# Updating Your Kobweb Project to Kotlin 2.0.0

[Kotlin 2.0.0 is out](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/whatsnew20.html), featuring support for the new K2 compiler. Kobweb
supports K2 starting with version 0.19.0. Unfortunately, due to changes in Kotlin & Compose, projects will need to
update their build scripts when upgrading to Kotlin 2.0.0 and Kobweb 0.19.0.

To ease the migration, we have prepared a Gradle task that will attempt to migrate your project in place. After editing
your `gradle/libs.versions.toml` file to use Kobweb 0.19.0, run  `./gradlew kobwebMigrateToK2` in the root of your
project:

```bash
$ ./gradlew kobwebMigrateToK2

> Task :kobwebMigrateToK2
Updated gradle\libs.versions.toml
Updated .gitignore
Updated site\build.gradle.kts
Updated site\.kobweb\conf.yaml

4 file(s) were updated.
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `kobwebMigrateToK2` task assumes your project follows the standard structure used by the Kobweb templates. For
> projects with non-standard structure, a manual migration may be required. See below for details on both the required
> and recommended migration steps.

The migration task performs the following actions:

- *(Required)* Updates the Kotlin version to `2.0.0`
- *(Recommended)* Updates the Jetbrains Compose version to `1.6.10` (NOTE: This is *Required* if continuing to use the
  Jetbrains Compose Gradle plugin)
- *(Required)* Applies
  the [new Compose compiler Gradle plugin](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/compose-compiler.html)
  to every Kobweb module
- *(Recommended)* Removes the Jetbrains Compose Gradle plugin from every Kobweb module & replaces compose dependency
  declarations
  with new version catalog entries
    - Now that the Compose compiler is applied with its own Gradle plugin, there is no requirement to use the
      Jetbrains Compose plugin, which focuses on Compose Multiplatform features that are not generally relevant for
      Kobweb projects. As part of migrating away from this plugin, the following dependency entries are added to the
      project's `libs.versions.toml` file:
      ```toml
      [libraries]
      compose-html-core = { module = "org.jetbrains.compose.html:html-core", version.ref = "jetbrains-compose" }
      compose-runtime = { module = "org.jetbrains.compose.runtime:runtime", version.ref = "jetbrains-compose" }
      ```
      and the `build.gradle.kts` files are migrated to use these new dependencies:
      ```kotlin
      // Before 
      implementation(compose.runtime)
      implementation(compose.html.core)
      // After 
      implementation(libs.compose.runtime)
      implementation(libs.compose.html.core)
      ```
- *(Required)* Updates any `.kobweb/conf.yaml` files to refer to the new Kotlin compilation directory, which changed
  from `dist` to `kotlin-webpack`:
  ```diff
  dev:
    contentRoot: "build/processedResources/js/main/public"
  -  script: "build/dist/js/developmentExecutable/<site>.js"
  +  script: "build/kotlin-webpack/js/developmentExecutable/<site>.js"
    api: "build/libs/<site>.jar"
  prod:
  -  script: "build/dist/js/productionExecutable/<site>.js"
  +  script: "build/kotlin-webpack/js/productionExecutable/<site>.js"
  ```
- *(Recommended)* Updates the project's `.gitignore` file to exclude
  the [new `.kotlin` Kotlin data directory](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/whatsnew20.html#new-directory-for-kotlin-data-in-gradle-projects)

## Optional Steps

- The Kobweb & Kotlin Gradle plugins now
  support [configuration cache](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/configuration_cache.html) for faster build
  times. Enable it by adding `org.gradle.configuration-cache=true` to your `gradle.properties` file.

- If you have a Kobweb-only project, you can likely remove the `jetbrains-compose` plugin entry from your version
  catalog entirely:

  ```diff
  - jetbrains-compose = { id = "org.jetbrains.compose", version.ref = "jetbrains-compose" }
  ```

  You may additionally have to remove it from your root `build.gradle.kts` file:

  ```diff
  - alias(libs.plugins.jetbrains.compose) apply false
  ```

- Consider trying the [new Kotlin/JS ES2015 target](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/whatsnew20.html#new-compilation-target):

  ```kotlin
  kotlin {
      configAsKobwebApplication("site")
      js {
          @OptIn(ExperimentalKotlinGradlePluginApi::class)
          compilerOptions.target = "es2015"
      }
  }
  ```
  This is likely to reduce your site's bundle size.

  the  [ones for Kotlin/JS](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/whatsnew20.html#kotlin-js), which include:
    - Per-file compilation for Kotlin/JS projects
    - Improved collection interoperability
    - Support for type-safe plain JavaScript objects
    - Support for npm package manager
